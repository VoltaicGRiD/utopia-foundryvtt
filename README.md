## Introduction

  

Welcome to the **Utopia TTRPG** system for **Foundry Virtual Tabletop**! This system (hopes-to) seamlessly integrates the rules and setting from **Utopia**, created by **Oridont @ Myramyth**, into Foundry VTT.

  

This repository is **open source**, allowing you to review, learn from, and extend the code. However, as the **sole licensed developer** under contract with Oridont @ Myramyth, I maintain official control of the codebase’s core development. That means:

  

- **Community macro/module development is encouraged.**  

- **Forking for personal use is absolutpely fine.**  

- **Official merges of third-party changes won’t be accepted** under this contract.

  

Please read below for more details on licensing, usage, and how you can tailor this system to your own needs.
