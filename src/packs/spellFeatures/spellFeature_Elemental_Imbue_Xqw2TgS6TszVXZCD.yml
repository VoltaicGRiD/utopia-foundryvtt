    <p style="text-align: left;">All weapons and creatures affected become
    imbued, dealing an additional 1d4 damage on its next attack. The type may be
    chosen between Energy, Heat, or Chill. Damage dice may be redistributed in
    any fashion as long as the maximum damage per damage type is the same. Each
    creature affected receives additional damage during its next weaponless
    attack. </p><p style="text-align: left;">Imbuement damage does not gain the
    features of the weapon, such as ignoring SHP or ignoring defenses. </p><p
    style="text-align: left;">Weapons and creatures that are already imbued
    cannot be affected this way.</p>
