    <p style="text-align: left;">All affected, available, non-living bodies
    become animated, each turning into an animated creature, the exact stats
    chosen by the caster and the GM (A single body may have multiple usable stat
    blocks). Each creature stays animated for the spell's duration, and the
    caster may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to command any of the
    creatures or to give a creature free will. </p><p style="text-align:
    left;">Animated creatures may be up to a DR X, and the caster will be aware
    of what type of creature will be created prior to casting the spell. A
    "non-living body‚Äù may be the body of any creature that has died, artificial
    constructs with motor capability, or things of similar capacity. GM
    discretion may be required. </p><p style="text-align: left;">If a creature
    in stasis is affected this way, its DHP and stamina each become 1 and it
    gains free will immediately instead. It does not lose animation when the
    spell ends.</p>
