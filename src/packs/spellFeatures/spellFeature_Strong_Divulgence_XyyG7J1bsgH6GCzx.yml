  description: >-
    <p style="text-align: left;">The caster chooses an affected object with an
    analog capability, such as a dial able to show a spectrum of states (such as
    partially turned, fully turned, or not turned at all). The caster may ask
    any question that has a similar spectrum of answers, such as “How close are
    we to our destination?". </p><p style="text-align: left;">The object
    magically responds with an accurate, definitive answer to the question,
    given it is able to. If the answer is magically obstructed or the question
    is unanswerable, it may return “null”, in which the object will respond with
    an answer other than what was originally considered. If the question is
    unclear, details will either be assumed or the object will return null.
    Answers are determined by the GM. </p><p style="text-align: left;">If the
    answer requires knowledge of future events, it responds with null.</p>
